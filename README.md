I used ChatGPT 4o to helped me write a majority of the **documentation** of this project.

# Personal Finance Manager in C++

## Introduction
This project is a personal finance management tool built in C++. It allows users to track their expenses and incomes, and generate financial reports to better understand their spending habits. The main use is to showcase skills that I can list on my resume.

**Developed a Finance Management System**: leveraged object-oriented programming, data structures, higher-end critical thinking skills 
- Used specific finance analysts’ tools, such as tracking spending, and future and current expenses. 
- Designed and integrated an automated financial report generation, that provides the end user with valuable information about their spending trends, giving them personal insight into their financial health 
- The usage of object-oriented programming allows for optimized performance, reusing functions, and involving processes like recursion, scalable for future edits to be made.  
- The generative UI allows for dynamic and remote interaction with the program allowing for detailed categorization, editing, and deletion of financial entries.

## Features
- **User Account Management**: Register, login, and manage user information securely.
- **Transaction Recording**: Record and categorize expenses and incomes with detailed descriptions.
- **Monthly Financial Reports**: Generate comprehensive reports and categorial breakdowns to analyze spending habits.
- **Data Persistence**: Save and load user data and transactions securely using file handling.
